This is a speech adapter, running in user space,
based on the acsint / acsbridge system.
It is modeled after my Jupiter speech adapter that lives in the kernel,
but we don't have to be in the kernel any longer!

This is so new it's embryonic.
But we may as well track it from the beginning, eh?

jcmd.c implements the speech commands and is the heart of the adapter.

The key bindings are in jup.cfg.

jencode.c encodes certain constructs like dates and times and phone numbers
and addresses etc, and jxlate.c translates these back out into words.
Thus 02/03/1932 becomes
february third nineteen thirdy 2
You can exercise the text preprocessor, without running the adapter,
by running
jupiter tts
or
jupiter ltts
ltts reads punctuations literally, every one of them.
That may sound like overkill, but that's what I do 99.9% of the time.
Perhaps because I'm a programmer - every punctuation is important.
Even when I read a story, I'd rather hear the word comma than a pause.
tts-trial has text to experiment with.
jupiter ltts <tts-trial
